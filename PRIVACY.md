# Privacy Policy — uis-mcp-server

**Effective date:** 2026-08-07 · **Service:** `https://uis.sidneybissoli.com` (remote MCP server)

This service provides read-only access to public statistics from the UNESCO
Institute for Statistics (UIS) Data API — education, science, culture and
demographic/socioeconomic indicators. It requires no account, no login, and no
API key.

## What we collect

- **Nothing that identifies you.** The server does not log query content, tool
  parameters, request bodies, or any user data.
- **Aggregate usage metrics only:** event type (request, tool call, tool error,
  rate-limited), tool or route name, and daily counts. These aggregates contain
  no IP addresses and no query content, and are publicly visible at `/metrics`.
- **MCP session id and client name:** on each `initialize` the server issues
  a random session id (UUID v4) and the client echoes it on later requests. It
  is kept only in the aggregate usage telemetry, to link the messages of one
  handshake; it is not stored server-side and identifies neither a person nor
  a device. The name of the client software declared in the handshake
  (`clientInfo.name`, normalised) is recorded on the handshake line only.
- **Rate limiting** uses the client IP in ephemeral in-process memory only
  (token bucket). It is never persisted or logged by the application.

## Infrastructure

The service runs on Cloudflare Workers. Cloudflare, as hosting provider, may
process connection metadata (including IP addresses) per its own
[privacy policy](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/).

## Upstream requests

Your queries are translated into requests to the public UIS Data API
(`api.uis.unesco.org`). No user-identifying information is forwarded upstream.

## Data license

Statistical data returned by this service comes from the UNESCO Institute for
Statistics and is licensed CC BY-SA 4.0. Every response carries a provenance
block (source URL, fixed data release, extraction date, license). This service
is not endorsed by UNESCO.
